# Latex Shortcuts for vim
This plugin contains all the shortcuts, I use for a day-to-day basis, This setup is inspired by Luke Smith (on yt).
## Installation
If using vim-plug, add the following line to your vimrc.
```vim
call plug#begin()
...
Plug 'tanushbanerjee/latex-shortcuts-vim'
call plug#end()
```
To view the pdf, you need to have zathura installed, and for compiling it obviously you should have LaTeX and latexmk installed.
